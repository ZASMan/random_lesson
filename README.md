# Time Format Execise
# Directions
Write a ruby class that can accept a block to initialize, and has a method called `add_minutes` which takes a first string arguement in the format of "9:13 AM" and then a string arguement like 10 and returns a result like "9:23 AM"

# TODO
Write more test cases to test for different values being added like adding minutes greater than an hour
